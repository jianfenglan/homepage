Jeff is a Ph.D. candidate (combined with Master program) at School of Media and Communication, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. Yi Mou. His research interests focus on the impact of human-AI interaction (HAII) on individual perceptions of intimacy and motality. Before joining SJTU, he received his B.A. in Journalism from School of Journalism, Chongqing University, advised by Prof. Junjie Pu. 

He currently serves as the Assitant Editor for journal Big Data & Society (SSCI, Q1), and the Editorial Assistant for journal Emerging Media. He also serves as the peer reviewer for journals like New Media & Society (SSCI, Q1) and Psychology of Popular Media (SSCI, Q2), and for conferences like ICA, NCA, AEJMC, IAMCR, ICIS, KACA et al. He is the Student Committee Chair (2024-2026) for the Association for Chinese Communication Studies (ACCS, affliated by NCA), and the Graduate Student Representative (2024-2025) for the Communication and the Future Division at National Communication Association.

蓝剑锋现为上海交通大学媒体与传播学院博士候选人（硕博连读），导师为牟怡教授。他的研究兴趣集中在人与AI交互对个体亲密观和死亡观的影响。蓝剑锋曾于重庆大学新闻学院取得新闻学学士学位，导师为蒲俊杰教授。

他现担任英文期刊Big Data & Society(SSCI, Q1)助理编辑，和英文期刊Emerging Media编辑助理。他也为英文期刊New Media & Society (SSCI, Q1),Psychology of Popular Media (SSCI, Q2)，以及ICA, NCA, AEJMC, IAMCR, ICIS, KACA等学术会议审稿人。他担任中华传播学会（NCA附属组织）学生委员主席(2024-2026)以及美国传播学协会传播与未来分会研究生代表(2024-2025)。

In an era where human-computer interaction continually reshapes societal dynamics, understanding the intricate relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and human social structures is paramount. My academic pursuits are deeply rooted in examining how AI and communication technologies influence and transform our social relationships, societal norms, and underlying philosophies. Built upon the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, I proposed the Social Actors as Computer-like (SAAC) hypothesis, trying to explore the reciprocal influence between humans and AI systems, particularly focusing on Intimacy and Death in the digital age, which I would like to frame my research as Love, Death and Artificial Intelligence. 

AI is reshaping social norms and values. People’s fear of death diminishes as digital immortality becomes normalized, and individuals choose to love robots or embrace robotic modes of love. While emerging media continues to change our existence, we still do not know whether the notion that SAAC is ultimately beneficial. However, I firmly believe it is imperative to explore this question thoroughly—before the singularity (or winter?) arrives.

在人机交互不断重塑社会图景的时代，深刻理解人工智能（AI）与人类社会结构之间的复杂建构关系，已成为一项核心学术议程。我的研究根植于对一个根本问题的考察：人工智能与传播技术正如何影响乃至重塑人类的社会交往、规范体系及其本体论基础。以“计算机作为社会行动者”（CASA）范式为理论基石，我尝试提出“社会行动者计算机化”（SAAC）的假说，旨在阐明人与AI系统之间相互塑造的动态过程，尤其关注数字背景下的亲密关系与死亡这两个核心议题。我将此研究框架界定为：“爱，死亡与人工智能”。

人工智能正在对既有的社会规范与价值体系形成冲击。当“数字永生”从想象变为日常，人类对死亡的焦虑或将得以缓解，转而选择与机器人相爱，或拥抱一种程序化的情感模式。新兴媒介持续重构着我们的存在方式，然而SAAC的提出究竟是否最终裨益于人类社会，仍是一个悬而未决的问题。但我坚信，在“奇点”（或“凛冬”）纪元到来之前，我们必须对这一命题展开系统而深刻的审思。
