Jeff is a Ph.D. candidate (combined with Master program) at School of Media and Communication, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. Yi Mou. His research interests focus on the impact of human-AI interaction (HAII) on individual perceptions of intimacy and motality. Before joining SJTU, he received his B.A. in Journalism from School of Journalism, Chongqing University, advised by Prof. Junjie Pu. 

He currently serves as the Assitant Editor for journal Big Data & Society (SSCI, Q1), and the Editorial Assistant for journal Emerging Media. He also serves as the peer reviewer for journals like New Media & Society (SSCI, Q1) and Psychology of Popular Media (SSCI, Q2), and for conferences like ICA, NCA, AEJMC, IAMCR, ICIS, KACA et al.

Research Interests
======
In an era where human-computer interaction continually reshapes societal dynamics, understanding the intricate relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and human social structures is paramount. My academic pursuits are deeply rooted in examining how AI and communication technologies influence and transform our social relationships, societal norms, and underlying philosophies. Built upon the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, I proposed the Social Actors as Computer-like (SAAC) hypothesis, trying to explore the reciprocal influence between humans and AI systems, particularly focusing on Intimacy and Death in the digital age, which I would like to frame my research as Love, Death and Artificial Intelligence. 

AI is reshaping social norms and values. People’s fear of death diminishes as digital immortality becomes normalized, and individuals choose to love robots or embrace robotic modes of love. While emerging media continues to change our existence, we still do not know whether the notion that SAAC is ultimately beneficial. However, I firmly believe it is imperative to explore this question thoroughly—before the singularity (or winter?) arrives.
