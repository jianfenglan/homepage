About Me | 关于我
======
Jeff is a Ph.D. candidate (combined with Master program) at School of Media and Communication, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, advised by Prof. Yi Mou. His research interests focus on the impact of human-AI interaction (HAII) on individual perceptions of intimacy and motality. Before joining SJTU, he received his B.A. in Journalism from School of Journalism, Chongqing University, advised by Prof. Junjie Pu. 

蓝剑锋现为上海交通大学媒体与传播学院博士候选人（硕博连读），导师为牟怡教授。他的研究兴趣集中在人与AI交互对个体亲密观和死亡观的影响。蓝剑锋曾于重庆大学新闻学院取得新闻学学士学位，导师为蒲俊杰教授。


Jeff currently serves as the Assitant Editor for journal Big Data & Society (SSCI, Q1), and the Editorial Assistant for journal Emerging Media. He also serves as the peer reviewer for journals like New Media & Society (SSCI, Q1) and Psychology of Popular Media (SSCI, Q2), and for conferences like ICA, NCA, AEJMC, IAMCR, ICIS, KACA et al. He's currently serving as the Student Committee Chair for the Association for Chinese Communication Studies (ACCS, affliated by NCA), and the Graduate Student Representative for the Communication and the Future Division at National Communication Association.

In an era where human-computer interaction continually reshapes societal dynamics, understanding the intricate relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and human social structures is paramount. My academic pursuits are deeply rooted in examining how AI and communication technologies influence and transform our social relationships, societal norms, and underlying philosophies. Built upon the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, I proposed the Social Actors as Computer-like (SAAC) hypothesis, trying to explore the reciprocal influence between humans and AI systems, particularly focusing on Intimacy and Death in the digital age, which I would like to frame my research as Love, Death and Artificial Intelligence. 

AI is reshaping social norms and values. People’s fear of death diminishes as digital immortality becomes normalized, and individuals choose to love robots or embrace robotic modes of love. While emerging media continues to change our existence, we still do not know whether the notion that SAAC is ultimately beneficial. However, I firmly believe it is imperative to explore this question thoroughly—before the singularity (or winter?) arrives.

在人机交互不断重塑社会动态的时代，理解人工智能（AI）与人类社会结构之间错综复杂的关系至关重要。我的研究植根于探讨AI和传播技术如何影响并重塑我们的社会关系、社会规范以及底层哲学。基于“计算机作为社会行为者”（CASA）范式，我想提出“社会行为者计算机化”（SAAC）假说，致力于探索人类与AI的相互影响，尤其关注数字时代中的亲密关系与死亡议题，我希望将我的研究框架命名为“爱，死亡与人工智能”。

人工智能正在重塑社会规范与价值观。随着数字永生方兴未艾，人们对死亡的恐惧逐渐减弱，个体开始选择去爱上机器人或接受机器人式的爱。尽管新兴媒体持续改变我们的存在方式，但我们仍不清楚SAAC假说是否具有积极的社会意义。然而，我坚信在奇点（或凛冬？）到来之前，有必要对这个问题进行深刻的探讨。
