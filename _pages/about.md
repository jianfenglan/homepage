Research
======
In an era where human-computer interaction continually reshapes societal dynamics, understanding the intricate relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and human social structures is paramount. My academic pursuits are deeply rooted in examining how AI and communication technologies influence and transform our social relationships, societal norms, and underlying philosophies. Built upon the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, I proposed the Social Actors as Computer-like (SAAC) hypothesis, trying to explore the reciprocal influence between humans and AI systems, particularly focusing on Intimacy and Death in the digital age, which I would like to frame my research as Love, Death and Artificial Intelligence. 

AI is reshaping social norms and values. People’s fear of death diminishes as digital immortality becomes normalized, and individuals choose to love robots or embrace robotic modes of love. While emerging media continues to change our existence, we still do not know whether the notion that SAAC is ultimately beneficial. However, I firmly believe it is imperative to explore this question thoroughly—before the singularity (or winter?) arrives.
