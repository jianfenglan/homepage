                I would especially like to thank Dr. Patrick, and Dr. Dongjing for including me at The Tenth Annual U.S.-China Communication Scholars Summit and for providing the opportunity to share my latest work.

            <p>
                I thoroughly enjoyed my time in Australia. Cozy was the word I used most frequently during my stay.
            </p>
            <p>
                This year, I and my colleague Kelsie, Christina and Zhi shared two papers about AIGC regulation, emerging media usage and body image issues of adolescents in China.

                Academic research not only provided a sense of achievement but also fostered valuable friendships. Delighted to meet everyone here!

            <p>
                This summer, I'm really honored to attend SICSS-Singapore at beautiful National University of Singapore. Five days' talks and discussions were beyond insightful and full of joy. Special thanks to Han Li, Rongxin, Anita, Jinyuan, Xuejiao and Renwen for their uncompromising care and careful organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, thanks to the speakers' generous sharing about their research, it was so inspiring. I highly recommend you sign up for the future SICSS-Singapore event and you won't regret for this decision.

                I was eager to engage in discourse, to gain insight, and to pursue academic inquiry. Fortunately, I received considerable assistance and support. I regard this academic excursion as a pivotal experience in my life, one that also initiated a new phase.
